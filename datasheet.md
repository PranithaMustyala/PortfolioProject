# Student Personalised Learning Datasheet Documentation

## Motivation
* The dataset was created to analyse and predict students' final scores based on various factors such as engagement, parental involvement, learning styles, and study habits.
* The dataset was developed as part of a research initiative on personalised learning models. It is intended for educational research and machine learning applications.
* The funding source for the dataset's creation is not explicitly mentioned.

## Composition
* The dataset consists of records representing individual students, with features such as age, gender, study habits, engagement level, and previous scores.
* The dataset contains numerical and categorical attributes, encoded where necessary for machine learning.
* There were missing values in the dataset, which were handled by removing incomplete records.
* The dataset does not contain personally identifiable or legally confidential information.

## Collection Process
* The data was acquired through surveys, student records, and educational performance tracking.
* If it is a sample, the sampling strategy was likely random selection from an educational institution or an online learning platform.
* The data collection occurred over a period of time that is not explicitly mentioned.

## Preprocessing/Cleaning/Labeling
* Preprocessing included handling missing values by removing incomplete entries.
* Categorical variables (e.g., gender, learning style) were one-hot encoded.
* Numerical features were standardised using `StandardScaler` to improve model performance.
* The raw data may not have been explicitly saved post-processing.

## Uses
* The dataset can be used for various educational data mining tasks, including:
   * Predicting student performance
   * Identifying factors that influence learning outcomes
   * Personalising learning recommendations
* Potential biases in the dataset should be considered to ensure fairness, particularly in areas like gender or learning resource availability.
* The dataset should not be used for high-stakes decisions that could adversely impact students without further validation.

## Distribution
* The dataset is currently used within this machine learning project and has not been formally distributed.
* The dataset may be subject to institutional policies regarding educational data privacy.

## Maintenance
* The dataset's maintenance responsibility is unclear, but it should ideally be managed by an educational research team or an organisation focusing on student performance analytics.
