# PortfolioProject: Personalised Learning Performance Prediction

## Non-Technical Explanation of Your Project
This project aims to predict students' final scores based on factors such as engagement, study habits, and learning styles. By analysing these variables, the model helps educators and students understand which factors contribute most to academic success, enabling personalised learning recommendations.

**Data:** Student features (age, study hours, engagement) from anonymized educational records
Models: Tested Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Network
Best Performance: Random Forest (MAE: 3.85, RÂ²: 0.76)

**Features**
Hyperparameter optimization via GridSearchCV
Feature importance analysis
Cross-validation for reliability

The model helps identify key success factors in personalized learning environments.

Random Forest performed the best in terms of accuracy and error minimisation.
